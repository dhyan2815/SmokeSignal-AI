# SmokeSignal AI

**A CNN‚Äìbased wildfire detection system** that analyzes satellite images to identify potential wildfires and sends automated alerts to emergency contacts.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Deep learning model for accurate wildfire identification
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant processing with confidence scoring
- **Automated Alerts**: Email notifications to fire stations and emergency services
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, professional Streamlit web application
- **Config-Aware Alerts**: Auto-enables email alerts when credentials are set
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based email setup (no credentials in code)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed detection confidence levels

## How SmokeSignal AI works?

Just upload your satellite image‚ÄîSmokeSignal AI instantly scans for wildfire signs, delivers a confidence score, and, if danger is detected, triggers real-time email alerts to keep you and emergency teams ahead of the threat.

## What SmokeSignal-AI Detects

### Active Fire Indicators

- Smoke plumes and visible fire
- Bright thermal signatures
- Active fire areas and flame patterns

### Environmental Changes

- Burn scars and damage areas
- Thermal anomalies and heat patterns
- Vegetation changes indicating fire activity

## Technical Architecture

### Model Framework

- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Input**: Satellite images (auto-resized)
- **Output**: Binary classification with confidence scores
- **Processing**: Real-time analysis pipeline

### Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Image Loading**: Multi-format support (JPG, PNG)
2. **Resizing**: Automatic dimension adjustment
3. **Normalization**: Pixel values scaled to [0, 1]
4. **Batch Processing**: Model-ready format

### Alert System

- **SMTP Integration**: Gmail SMTP for reliability
- **Rich Content**: Timestamps, confidence scores, details
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user feedback

## User Interface Features

- **Clean detection interface** with file uploader
- **Expandable quick guide** for minimal, high-signal help
- **Real-time analysis** with progress/status indicator
- **Concise results display** with confidence score

## Data Privacy

- Images are processed in-memory for analysis and are not stored by the app.
- Email alerts include only detection metadata (timestamp, confidence, basic image info).
- No personal information is collected.

## Acknowledgments

- **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning framework
- **Streamlit** for the web application framework
- **OpenCV** for image processing capabilities
- **Gmail SMTP** for reliable email delivery
