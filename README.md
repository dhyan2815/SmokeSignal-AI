### Model Framework

- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Input**: Satellite images (auto-resized)
- **Output**: Binary classification with confidence scores
- **Processing**: Real-time analysis pipeline

### Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Image Loading**: Multi-format support (JPG, PNG)
2. **Resizing**: Automatic dimension adjustment
3. **Normalization**: Pixel values scaled to [0, 1]
4. **Batch Processing**: Model-ready format

### Alert System

- **SMTP Integration**: Gmail SMTP for reliability
- **Rich Content**: Timestamps, confidence scores, details
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user feedback

## User Interface Features

- **Clean detection interface** with file uploader
- **Expandable quick guide** for minimal, high-signal help
- **Real-time analysis** with progress/status indicator
- **Concise results display** with confidence score

## Data Privacy

- Images are processed in-memory for analysis and are not stored by the app.
- Email alerts include only detection metadata (timestamp, confidence, basic image info).
- No personal information is collected.

## Acknowledgments

- **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning framework
- **Streamlit** for the web application framework
- **OpenCV** for image processing capabilities
- **Gmail SMTP** for reliable email delivery
