## How SmokeSignal AI works?

### Simple 3-Step Process

1. **Upload Image**
   - Click "Browse files" on the main page
   - Select any satellite/aerial image (JPG, PNG)
   - Image is automatically processed

2. **AI Analysis**
   - System analyzes for wildfire indicators
   - Detects smoke plumes, fire areas, thermal signatures
   - Provides confidence score (0-100%)

3. **Results & Alerts**
   - **Wildfire Detected**: Shows confidence, timestamp, email alert
   - **No Wildfire**: Confirms area is safe
   - **Email Alerts**: Instant notifications to emergency services

### Email Alert Configuration

1. **Enable Alerts**: Check "Enable Email Alerts" in sidebar
2. **Verify Status**: Confirm email credentials are loaded
3. **Receive Notifications**: Get instant alerts for detected wildfires

##  Demo Examples

### Example 1: Wildfire Detection
```
Upload: satellite_image_with_smoke.jpg
Result: üî• Wildfire Detected
Confidence: 87.5%
Alert: Email sent to fire station
Timestamp: 2024-01-15 14:30:25
```

### Example 2: Safe Area
```
Upload: clear_forest_area.jpg
Result: ‚úÖ No Wildfire Detected
Confidence: 12.3%
Status: Area appears safe
```

### Example 3: High Confidence Detection
```
Upload: active_fire_zone.jpg
Result: üî• Wildfire Detected
Confidence: 94.2%
Alert: High-priority notification sent
```

## What the SmokeSignal Detects
